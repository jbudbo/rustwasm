# Note

The content here is the result of following the guide found here:
[https://rustwasm.github.io/book/game-of-life/hello-world.html](https://rustwasm.github.io/book/game-of-life/hello-world.html)

Therefore, a fair amount of the content under "rusty-justy-wasm" and "rusty-justy-wasm/www" belongs to other git repos from those authors.

I have added the full contents of these directories simply for the purpose of capturing the work that I did.
